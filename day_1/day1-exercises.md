1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  - The purpose is that HTML is the structure of a website, it's like a site's skeleton, you start building the bare basics.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  - The best way I can describe it is as, a tag is only part of an element such as <h1> this alone would be a tag, but when you add the closing portion </h1> then it becomes an element, so an element is both the opening and closing tag.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  - They provide additional information about the contents of an element, they do this by appearing in the opening tag and they have two parts a name and a value both are separated by an equals sign or known as the assignment operator.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  - The <head> element contains information ABOUT the page, rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser.
  - The <title> element are shown on the top of the browser, above where the URL is.
  - The <body> element is what is shown within the main browser, everything in this element will be the main focus of your user.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  - cmd + option + i

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  - `<b></b>` is a bold element, it makes texts bold
  - `<i></i>` is for italic elements
  - `<sup> </sup>` is for superscript it actually is pretty cool because it does the little 2's for raising a number to that power **it would be a good thing to note that sup goes on top**
  - `<sub></sub>` is for subscript and it gives off the little numbers that go underneath such as H20 **Note that sup goes on top and sub goes underneath**
  - `<abbr></abbr>` for abbreviations for acronyms it could be use to specify the full term.

7.  What are empty elements?
    - empty elements are elements without a child, or in other words without a closing tag.

8.  What is semantic markup?
  - a way of writing HTML so that it reinforces the idea that HTML should be used for structuring a webpage and CSS should be used to style a webpage instead of relying on HTML alone. It also means HTML tags are never chose based on the way they appear on the browser but instead chosen based on the importance and structure of the content.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
 - From my very basic understanding the hold HTML used to put <div id = " "> on everything, the headers the navs, the articles. the new HTML 5  version removed the <div id> on a lot of sections now replacing them with their respective names. This could allow screen readers to ignore headers and footers and deliver the main content of a site.
